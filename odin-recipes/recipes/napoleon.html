    <h2>Descroption</h2>
    <p>The Napoleon cake is composed of many layers of puff pastry with a whipped pastry cream filling and encrusted with more pastry crumbs.
        After assembling, the cake is chilled overnight to allow the pastry layers to soften and absorb some of the cream, similar to the classic
        American icebox cake. The Napoleon cake takes inspiration from the French mille-feuille or Napoleon dessert, which is also traditionally
        made with layers of puff pastry and pastry cream, but it isn’t the same dessert. While a Napoleon dessert has just a few thicker layers
        of pastry and cream, the Napoleon cake traditionally has at least 8 very thin layers of pastry spread with cream—and sometimes as many
        as 12! It’s more similar to a crepe cake than it is to a traditional Napoleon dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditionally, Napoleon cake is filled with pastry cream: a cornstarch-thickened custard that’s cooked on the stovetop until it becomes
        thick and pudding-like. We’ve stuck pretty close to the classic in this recipe, with the addition of whipped cream, which we fold into
        the chilled pastry cream to lighten it up. The result is a light, creamy, luscious filling, perfect for sandwiching between those puff
        pastry layers.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large egg yolks (112 g.) </li>
        <li>1/2 c. (56 g.) cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>  
        <li>1 c. (198 g.) granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>4 c. (946 mL) whole milk</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. (1/2 stick; 57 g.) butter, room temperature</li> 
        <li>4 tsp. vanilla extract</li> 
        <li>2 c. (473 mL) heavy cream</li> 
        <li>2 (1-lb.) boxes puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for rolling</li>
        <li>Mixed fresh berries, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large heatproof bowl, whisk egg yolks, cornstarch, salt, and 1/2 cup (99 g.) granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>
            In a medium pot over medium heat, heat milk and remaining 1/2 cup (98 g.) granulated sugar, stirring,
            until sugar is dissolved and milk is steaming. Whisking constantly, pour half of hot sugar milk into
            egg mixture. Pour milk-egg mixture into pot and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until pastry
            cream boils and thickens to a pudding-like consistency, 1 to 2 minutes. Cook, stirring, 1 minute more,
            then remove from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour hot pastry cream onto a rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto
            pastry cream. Refrigerate until cold.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Transfer cold pastry cream to another large bowl
            and stir until smooth. Stir one-quarter of whipped cream into pastry cream until combined. Using a rubber
            spatula, carefully fold in remaining whipped cream. Refrigerate pastry cream filling until ready to assemble.
        </li>
        <li>Make Ahead: Pastry cream (without whipped cream folded in) can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.</li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 400° and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove 1 sheet of puff
            pastry from refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to a 13"-by-13" square. Cut square
            into 2 rectangles, transfer to prepared baking sheet, and prick all over with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake, rotating sheet and flipping pastry halfway through, until deeply browned and crisp, 12 to 15 minutes.
            Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining 3 sheets of puff pastry for a total of 8 pastry rectangles.</li>
        <li>Stack 7 puff pastry rectangles on top of one another; set remaining 1 rectangle aside.
            Using a serrated knife, trim edges so rectangles are a uniform shape; reserve crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange 1 puff pastry rectangle on a platter. Spread 1 cup pastry cream filling over
            puff pastry rectangle; top with a second rectangle and spread with 1 cup filling. Repeat
            layering with 5 remaining rectangles and 5 cups filling. Cover sides of cake with remaining filling.
        </li>
        <li>Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate cake at least 4 hours or, preferably, up to overnight.</li>
        <li>
            Before serving, crush reserved puff pastry rectangle to fine crumbs, add to reserved crumbs, then press into
            sides and top of cake. Top with berries.
        </li>
    </ol>
